# menu_poc
Contains a simple menu based on JavaScript. The menu has been created while introducing myself to the capabilities of JavaScript.

## Introduction
The menu.js JavaScript file contains an object 'MenuEntry' which represents the Menu.
Call the function buildMenu() as event handler at an appropriate place in your code to parse and enable the menu.

The stylesheet menu.css contains basic styles for the menu and the example HTML file contained in the project.
